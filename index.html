              <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Judah Barton, I was born on January 19th 2000. I am the 12th of 13 children and am a firm believer in Jesus Christ. I have gone to 12 years of schooling (Elementary School Middle School, High School). In my junior and senior year of High School I did a program called running start which basically allowed me to go to clark college for the last 2 years of High School. I then took a year off and went to a bible school in Europe for 7 months. Now I am currently attending Epicodus. While in High school I began working in construction, I have been building homes for 3 years now and if you live in washington you know the winters suck. Which leads me to why I am doing Epicodus. I have always loved coding and have always wanted to code my own apps for a living, and I wanted to get the knowledge and skills to do that in as little time as possible. That is why I chose Epicodus. </p>
