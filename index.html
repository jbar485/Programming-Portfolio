                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Judah Barton, I was born on <em>January 19th 2000.</em> I am the 12th of 13 children and am a <strong>firm</strong> believer in Jesus Christ. I have gone to 12 years of schooling <span>(Elementary School Middle School, High School).</span> In my junior and senior year of High School I did a program called running start which basically allowed me to go to clark college for the last 2 years of High School. I then took a year off and went to a bible school in Europe for 7 months called <a href="https://bodenseehof.de/en">Bodenseehof</a>. Now I am currently attending <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>. While in High school I began working in construction, I have been building homes for 3 years now and if you live in washington you know the winters suck. Which leads me to why I am doing Epicodus. I have always <em>loved</em> coding and have always wanted to code my own apps for a living, and I wanted to get the knowledge and skills to do that in as little time as possible. That is why I chose Epicodus. </p>

                <p id="hook">This is by far one of my favorite book series I have ever read. It was a tough choice because I love to read a ton but this series is filled with so many good action packed scenes along with an easy to follow plot. I highly reccomend that you give this series a read.</p>
                <h2 class="final">Summary</h2>
                <p class="final">Imagine you’re driving down the interstate, it’s Friday and all you can think about is getting your weekend started. Then to begin the ruination of your much anticipated weekend the grating tone of the Emergency Alert System flashes over the radio, then promptly dies.This is the beginning of a 250 mile odyssey for Morgan Carter. Morgan works on the road and finds himself far from home when his car dies, as well as his Blackberry and every other piece of electronics he has. With no idea what has occurred he reluctantly finds himself on shanks’ mare carrying that ridiculous pack that everyone made fun of him for keeping in the car. Morgan has to find his way across the state of Florida, from Tallahassee to the heart of the state in Lake County. Along his way he has to seek out food, water and shelter where he can, not to mention keeping himself from being killed by any number of now scared and desperate people. During his travels he will try and help where he can, but that can turn out to be a costly mistake. We live in a wonderfully modern society where anything we want is a mouse click away. The lights come on with the flip of a switch and even a child can turn on the faucet at the sink and water always comes out. But what if it all went away? Could you face what Morgan faces, could you make the decisions he has to make? Life and sometimes death in the blink of an eye, could you do it?</p>
